# Codel
A wordle-like game using numbers instead of letters.

I initially did a Java-based Mastermind project at the end of high school, but I remembered it was probably my most in-depth project, so I felt like returning to it. I decided to update it by making it run on the web instead of using JavaFX. My family loves to play the Wordle game by NYT, and Mastermind is very similar to Wordle, so I decided to make Codel.

I will be updating it soon with features like difficulty levels and a code of the day feature, similar to Wordle.
